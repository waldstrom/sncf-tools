In this repo some quick and easy to use tools are collected that are useful for me (and maybe others) in the common research project of SNCF Reseau and FHNW: www.wilddrone.ch 

First addition is the WGS84-to-SNCF-PK.py:
It allows you to find the nearest Point Kilometre (PK) in 100m steps to a WGS84 coordinate. This is useful if geodata overlaps with railway processes, where Line and kilometre segment are commonly used to reference positions on the network.
I am using the "Liste des PKs" dataset by Nicolas Wurtz for this: https://github.com/nicolaswurtz/extras-opendata-sncf-reseau/tree/master
Thanks a lot!
